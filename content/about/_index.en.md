# About me :man:

My name is Farzad, I'm a seasoned DevOps and SRE Manager, Head of SRE at [Qonto](https://qonto.com), ex-Head of Platform
at [Kapten](https://kapten.com). I'm also an avid reader and bookworm :books: (fiction, comics, science-fiction, essays… and computer books of course :smile:).

# About books :books:

At Kapten, we started sharing our readings and reviews on an internal Slack channel.
I liked this idea so much that I cut & pasted my posts to a [Medium](https://medium.com/les-lectures-de-farzad) site
and continued posting new content there.

# About this site :factory:

If Medium and Slack work fine, then why create yet another personal blog?
Well, I'm not a *blogger* and will never pretend to be one…
 
But I'm a **geek**! I'm also an
expert in creating and maintaining very large IT infrastructures. As such, I wanted to practice
on my own all the tools and techniques that I learned at work to build this site using State-of-the-art knowledge.

The server and the whole surrounding (network, load balancer, DNS, security, TLS certificate…) are
fully built using [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code).
Everything is described using machine-readable definition files, store in a Git repository, can
be reviewed, and is deployed using only a few commands.

Everything needed to build this site from A to Z is on GitHub:
* [The Ansible / Terraform code for Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/Farzy/self-config)
* [The content, written using Hugo](https://github.com/Farzy/farzy.org)
