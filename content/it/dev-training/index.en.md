# Current status

Since May 2021 I'm the **Head of SRE** at **[GitGuardian](https://gitguardian.com)**, a cybersecurity company.

From January to March 2021 I was the **Head of SRE** at **[Qonto](https://qonto.com)**, managing 3 teams (Platform SRE, App SRE, Internal IT).

From 2017 to September 2020 I was the [Head of Infrastructure](https://linkedin.com/in/ffarid) at **[Kapten](https://kapten.com)** a leading European, ride-hailing company üöó

# How I started using training sites

As Kapten's parent company, Free Now (~~or should I call them Fire Now?~~ ‚ò†Ô∏è), had decided to fire the whole French Tech & Product teams instead
of merging with theirs, I started looking for a new job in May 2020 üò±

On top of this, due to the COVID-19 üò∑ crisis, our whole company had been working remotely for more than three months and my SRE/IT team had globally less work to do.

That's why I decided to make a profit of this free time and to improve my coding & algorithmic skills!
You'll find below the list of my personal repositories on
which I'm writing code. My main centers of interest today are the following (this may of course change over time):

**Note**: As I have started working again at the beginning of 2021, I have much less time for my personal improvement projects, so my progress is slower on the projects below.

# My training program

* **Rust**
    * [*DONE* ‚úÖ] I first used **[The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)** to teach myself Rust. Here is my training code: https://github.com/Farzy/rust-training
    * [*DONE* ‚úÖ] Then I practiced some more using the **Rustling** project: https://github.com/Farzy/rustlings
    * [**In Progress** üöß] I'm now practing mostly using **[Exercism.io](https://exercism.io)**, here is my code: https://github.com/Farzy/Exercism-rust
    * [**In Progress** üöß] I also started playing with **[CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/)** in Rust (and some Python 3): https://github.com/Farzy/CodinGame
* **Go**
    * [*DONE* ‚úÖ] I just (re)started the **[Go Tour](https://tour.golang.org/)**! I had already practised two years ago, but forgot everything‚Ä¶: https://github.com/Farzy/go-tour
    * [**In Progress** üöß] I also started the **[Exercism Go track](https://exercism.io/my/tracks/go)**: https://github.com/Farzy/Exercism-go
* **Python 3**
    * [*DONE* ‚úÖ] I started on the **[Python 3.8 tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/index.html)** of course: https://github.com/Farzy/python3-training
    * [*DONE* ‚úÖ] Then I tried **[Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/)** but I didn't really like the book‚Ä¶: https://github.com/Farzy/lpthw
    * [*DONE* ‚úÖ] Then I practised the whole **[30 days of code in Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/Farzy)** on HackerRank: https://github.com/Farzy/hackerrank/tree/master/30-days-of-code
    * [*DONE* ‚úÖ] I also did all the 115 Python exercises on **HackerRank**: https://github.com/Farzy/hackerrank/tree/master/python
* **Algorithmics**
    * [**In Progress** üöß] I'm currently training on the [Algorithmics / Problem solving course](https://www.hackerrank.com/Farzy) on **HackerRank**. I have answered around 30 problems: https://github.com/Farzy/hackerrank/tree/master/algorithms
* **Mathematics**
    * [**In Progress** üöß] I used to love maths, but then lost interest. Now I want to practise again, so I started training on **[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)**! I just hastily solved the first 2 problems and saw that if I took some more time, plus a pencil and a piece of paper, I could have found more elegant algorithms: https://github.com/Farzy/project-euler. I'm trying to use **Rust** for all problems üòä
* **Statistics**
    * [*DONE* ‚úÖ] I did the **10 days of statistic** on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/Farzy) in Rust, execept for one very complex exercice that I solved using Python 3 and NumPy / SciPy üòÖ https://github.com/Farzy/hackerrank/tree/master/statistics
* **Cryptography**
    * [**In Progress** üöß] I started the [Cryptopals challenge](https://cryptopals.com) for fun coding in Rust, to learn more about cryptography and to discover how cryptography can be broken: https://github.com/Farzy/cryptopals
* **X86-64 Assembly**
    * [**In Progress** üöß] I've started learning the basics of x86-64 assembly because‚Ä¶ why not? I won't go very far I think: https://github.com/Farzy/fant-asm. It's also an excuse for writing some small helper scripts in Rust.
