Some opinions on my recent readings:

![Blacksad 6](images/Blacksad%206.jpeg)

# Blacksad volume 6 

I really liked it. It is in the continuity of the previous ones, I find the same drawing, the same atmosphere, the suspense and the twists. I think it is on the level of the previous ones, I am just a little frustrated to have to wait for volume 7 with a cliffhanger.

# Les vieux fourneaux volume 2

I started the series with a lot of delay because despite the good reviews I had seen, the cover with the old and ugly characters didn't make me want to read it‚Ä¶ I bought the volume 1 second hand and I didn't regret it! It's hilarious and dynamic. Today I hesitated to buy volume 3, but the **[Goldorak collector](https://www.kana.fr/bd-goldorak-ledition-collector-limitee/)** was so heavy and bulky in my backpack that I gave up üòÇ

![Harleen - Nausica√§ 4](images/Harleen%20-%20Nausica√§%204.jpeg)

# Harleen

Great! Not only is the artwork great, but the story and characters are successful. I find the story quite believable and coherent, not being too demanding either. Surprisingly, ≈†tjepan Sejiƒá's Joker is almost beautiful in Harleen Quinzel's eyes, whereas I've been used to repulsive or disturbing depictions.

# Nausica√§ volume 4

Very nice, I like this series. But as I read each volume with a great temporal distance, I start to have trouble following the plot and the different protagonists: who is "bad", who is "good"? I fall back on my feet after a few pages and the reading remains pleasant.

# Th√©rapie de groupe volume 1

Larcenet really likes to put his psychological troubles in comics! I bought it because the theme of the author's psychology and neuroses interests me. I find it less nice than "Le combat ordinaire" or "Retour √† la terre", I smile more than I laugh, but I still bought volume 2 today to see if it will improve.

# Le Jardin, Paris

This is a comic that my eldest daughter, an amateur artist, bought because she follows the author on Instagram. We bought it at Super H√©ros Paris, and we were pleasantly surprised to find a signed and numbered bookmark inside üòç 

The drawing is nice but I find the story a bit strange, this boy named Rose, raised in a cabaret and who thrives on dancing, putting forward his feminine part. I didn't get completely hooked, but it's a good read. I can't get into the heads of the characters, their psychology seems strange to me. And when this man, rich and handsome, gets attached to Rose who seems to be a teenager, it's a "pedophilia" alarm that rings in my head while the author talks about a beautiful romance‚Ä¶

# Tout ce qui reste de nous

Again a choice of my eldest daughter who liked the cover. The three stories are strange, they take place in a futuristic universe, the third one is even set in science-fiction, but each time it's mainly the dreamlike, the attachment of the characters, the love, which are the main themes of the author. Here I really had a hard time getting into the stories, I think that I did not understand the message of the author and am left with mixed feelings‚Ä¶
