Here are my comic book readings for the end of October.

## Attack on Titans T34

End of this series that my granddaughter made me discover, first by the anime. I didn't think I would get addicted to a series whose main theme is the bloody dismemberment of humans by titans, with bloodshed at will... and yet :sweat_smile: The scenario of the last volumes was complicated, I had a bit of trouble to follow, but I enjoyed it until the end. The end is both joyful and dark, it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.

## The 5 Lands T1

I only knew this series by its covers which reminded me of the universe of anthropomorphic animals of Blacksad. A week ago, I was still hesitating to start this series, but one of the salesmen of my favorite comic book store was promoting it to a customer, and I fell for it :) I liked the story, dark and complex, but I had a hard time getting into it, because I find that all the animals of the same race are too similar! It kind of ruined the reading for me.

## Mon Papa by Reiser

I found this copy for 2 € at Boulinier in Paris, at the same time as "**On vit une époque formidable**". Reiser is a genius! His characters and the way he deals with problems of his time, the early 80's, are timeless: everything he writes could apply to our time. It's remarkable to find such a fine observation of France with such a deliberately "ugly" drawing. I love it!
