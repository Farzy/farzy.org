[Batman: A long Halloween](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_The_Long_Halloween) ([Un long Halloween](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_:_Un_long_Halloween>)) by Jeph Loeb & Time Sale was recommended to me by Batman fans in the [Bubble Family & Friends](https://www.facebook.com/groups/BubbleBD) Facebook group, a forum used by users of the excellent **Bubble** application that I use to manage my BD/Comics/Manga collection.

*Note*: This book is a fantastic American comics, I will therefore write this critics in English although I read it in French :slightly_smiling_face:  

I'm not really a super-hero fan so, for me, finding in which order comic books should be read and moreover which ones deserve to be read, is a perilous task! There are so many parallel stories, reboots, crossovers… If you're like me, a Batman fan but not a comics' nerd, you should first read [Batman: Year One]({{<ref "/books/batman-année-un-par-frank-miller-et-david-mazzucchelli">}}) by Frank Miller & David Mazzucchelli, a reboot of Batman's "birth", it's really excellent! And then you should read "A long Halloween".

A long Halloween is a very thick book, 400 pages for the French edition! I was first intimidated and did not like Bruce Wayne's drawing in the first pages, I thought I was going to waste my time… but after a few pages I could not put the book down anymore! I finished it in two evenings and loved it. 

The plot is very dense, there are many surprises, and many villains, Batman's recurring enemies, appear in the story, including the well known Catwoman and Joker. The story is about a trio's struggle (Batman the super-hero, James Gordon the honest cop and Harvey Dent the tough District Attorney) to get rid of the 2 families who control Gotham City (Maroni and Falcone's mafia) all the while solving a series of mysterious crimes, all committed on celebration days (Halloween, Christmas, Valentine's Day…).

The search for the criminal, named Holiday, will be very long, full of murders, plot twists, villains and darkness. 

I won't go into detail (and please be careful as the Wikipedia links I shared above contain spoilers!) but I really loved this book and recommend it!
