Let's dive in comics and Sci Fi at the same time with **M√©tal Hurlant** (Heavy Metal in English)! For those who don't know, M√©tal Hurlant, published between 1975 and 1987, then briefly from 2002 to 2004, is **the** reference comic / Sci Fi magazine that revolutionized contemporary comics at a time when comics were rather aimed at children, nice, familial, polished, smooth (Tintin, Asterix, Tanguy and Laverdure...).

Mythical authors such as Moebius, Caza, Bilal, Druillet, Giger, Tardi... have written and drawn in it. The works of this magazine have influenced many others like Mad Max, Alien, Blade Runner, etc. (it's not me who says so, I copied [Wikipedia's article](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9tal_hurlant) üòõ Major works of comics have been published in episodes in it: Moebius' Arzach, Jodorowsky and Moebius' Incal for example.

For those interested in Pop Rock culture, two of the creators/editors of the magazine are **Philippe Man≈ìuvre** and **Jean-Pierre Dionnet**, scriptwriters, journalists, rock critics... They also created the mythical television show **Les enfants du Rock** in the 80s! One of the programs that rocked my youth too üòç

I discovered Howling Metal indirectly in my youth, when the Canadian animated film **Heavy Metal** was released in 1981. The film deeply marked me by its aesthetics and I discovered it too late. I was too young to read it anyway...

There I snapped and I started buying second hand the magazines I could find, to realize my childhood dream. A few weeks ago I received volumes 1 to 6, in very good condition, real collectors! Given their fragility and rarity (the special Lovecraft special edition that I already had in pieces and costs apparently more than 60‚Ç¨) I do not lend them but you can come and read them at my place with pleasure üôÇ

**Update (2021/03/01)**: I now have the [complete collection]({{<ref "/books/m√©tal-hurlant-collection-compl√®te">}})!
