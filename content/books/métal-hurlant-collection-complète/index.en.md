I have finally realized a teenager's dream, whose origin goes back to the release of the Canadian film "Heavy Metal", produced by Ivan Reitman and released in 1981 üòç. This animated film, which had strongly marked me at the time, made me discover the French magazine **M√©tal Hurlant**. I already talked a bit about this magazine in [another article]({{<ref "/books/m√©tal-hurlant">}}).

I was too young to read it at the time (11 years old) and was therefore only 5 years old when the first issue came out in 1975. My father-in-law had just bought a copy when the film came out, a copy that disappeared a long time ago, I don't know where...

Since then, I discovered and appreciated in comics, and also in movies, the mythical authors such as Moebius, Druillet, Caza, Gotlib... Time passed and, in 2019, on a whim, I told myself that I was going to buy the whole collection!

I started buying the first issues on eBay in October 2019, then Rakuten and also some copies on Le Bon Coin. After almost a year and a half of research, I found and bought at the end of February 2021 the only issue I was missing, the #145, the second last issue of poor quality but very rare.

I took with pride this family photo which regroups the 132 issues published from 1975 to 1987, the 12 issues in US Comics format from 2002 to 2004, the final issue 146 of 2006, plus 22 special issues. However, I am missing the supplements (postcard, disc, 3D glasses...) that a few rare and wise collectors, including some of you, may have kept üòâ.

Fun fact: I shared this picture with a similar message on the Facebook group "Fan de M√©tal Hurlant" and **[Jean-Pierre Dionnet](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Dionnet)** himself, the co-creator of the magazine, liked and shared my photo :heart_eyes:  I also got a like from Jean-Christophe Menu, the creator of the comic book publisher **[L'Association](https://www.lassociation.fr/)** :sunglasses: It's almost as good as an autograph for me, ha ha!
