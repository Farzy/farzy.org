After the plethora of MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) movies and the WandaVision series I saw on Disney+ recently, a visit to a large Parisian bookstore specialized in
seen on Disney+ recently, a visit to a big Parisian bookstore specialized in comics
could only end with the purchase of this little booklet published by Panini.
I naively thought that it would allow me to better discover this strange couple...

Disappointing! So yes I laughed a lot, but in the second degree.

Wanda and The Vision is very bad overall. It's okay for the first of the four stories, 
it has a modern line, a smooth colorizationâ€¦

â€¦ but the three following
stories, but the three following
from the 70's are as bad as possible: ugly drawing, dialogues with no sense
(the rough French translation must make it worse), garish and slobbery colors, 
naive psychology, non-existent settings, incoherence within a story (not to mention
the global incoherence of the universe)...

The well-known characters are so ugly (Thor, Iron Man, Vision...) that I have a hard
time recognizing the MCU superheroes I liked.

Moreover, as they are isolated episodes and not complete stories, there are a lot of 
asterisks that refer to other comics that you have to have read in order to understand 
what's going on: "*See GSA 2*", "*See GSA 3*", "*See Dr Strange 7*", "*See Avenger 127*", 
"*See Defenders 1*"... It always gave me the impression that you have to have started 
reading in the 50's to be able to follow ðŸ˜‚

I smiled when I read the stories, but it was more out of derision than by the effect of any 
deliberate line of humor. Everything is written in the first degree, or else in the
third degree and that's why I missed it?

Sometimes I wonder how Americans can read this crap ðŸ˜…
