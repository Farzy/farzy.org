I just finished it after 2 days of reading, it's a shock! :scream: It's a realist painting of the dark side of the USA, the one we don't hear much about, if at all for some of the stories.

The author of the book that was used as a reference is a pacifist, this can be felt in the choice of the events told, but that does not take anything away from their strength and scope. I am both horrified and happy to have read this comic book.

There are stories that I already knew, those about the dictatorships in South America, and all the chaos introduced in Iran (I am of Iranian origin) but what is disgusting is that the US has been committing these atrocities continuously for 200 years, while at the same time working in parallel to their influence in the literary, artistic, scientific, etc. fields. These are not just a few dark historical "accidents". The two sides of the US are intimately intertwined, inseparable: the money of one finances the other.

For example, characters that we see in a rather positive (Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, Carter...) or just mixed (the banker J.P. Morgan, the Rockefeller family...) light appear here as monsters! Racists, liars, bloodthirsty, greedy, accomplices or sponsors of crimes.

I think that's what I remember above all: not everything is all white or all black, we must not burn or hate the USA after reading this comic book or the book that served as a model, but we must stop idealizing them.

I think we must take a step back, not seek revenge, not do worse, not set off an opposite swing: a "benevolent" oppression, revolt or counter-attack would not cancel out the oppressions of the past, they would only lead us towards an even worse, even totalitarian system.

Fortunately, the comic ends on a hopeful note. I also hope that the USA will be completely humanized one day, because I don't like totalitarian alternatives at all :sweat_smile:
